### Fixed

- Url and headers handling in service consumption

## Version 2.6.2 - 2020-11-04

### Fixed

- Augment read after write data with returned values of virtual properties on draft activate

## Version 2.6.1 - 2020-11-04

### Fixed

- Skip forbidden view check if association to view with foreign key in target

## Version 2.6.0 - 2020-11-03

### Added

- Support for `$expand` on managed Composition and Association to-one in structured types
- Support for CQN partials in `SELECT.orderBy()`
- `messages_<locale>.properties` files looked for in all i18n folders (not just the first)
- Structured types as key
- Support for localization in custom handlers
- `InsertResult` (beta):
  + iterator that returns the keys of the created entries, for example:
    - Example: `[...result]` -> `[{ ID: 1 }, { ID: 2 }, ...]`
    - in case of `INSERT...as(SELECT...)`, the iterator returns `{}` for each row
  + `affectedRows`: the number inserted (root) entries or the number of affectedRows in case of INSERT into SELECT
  + `valueOf()`: returns `affectedRows` such that comparisons like `result > 0` can be used
    - Note: `===` cannot be used as it also compares the type
- Authentication strategy `xsuaa` (only with `@sap/xssec^3`) that additionally provides access to saml attributes via `req.user.attr` (for example, `req.user.attr.familyName`)

### Changed

- SQL queries do not use placeholders for rows of LIMIT clause
- Replaced `@sap/odata-server` dependency by own copy
- On `PATCH` and `PUT`, an `UPDATE` event is followed by a `CREATE` event if there was no matching entity
- On `PUT`, not provided properties are defaulted/ nulled
- On HTTP requests, `req.data` is a copy to preserve the original payload
- Additional properties in payload are preserved for entities with `@cds.persistence.skip` when served to `rest`
- RemoteService: Ignore where clause of view definition during INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE instead of throwing error
- Do not use SQL placeholders for numbers
- Service-level `@requires` are checked in protocol adapter instead of ApplicationService (excluding metadata requests)

### Changed

- Streamlined `req.reject/error/info(code, msg, target, args)`: takes four individual params (number, string, string, array) or one object
- Changed behavior by handler registration: 
-- Handlers registered with entity = '*' are not called by unbound events anymore.
-- Handlers registered without entity are not called by bound events anymore.
-- Special case: Handlers registered in form .before/on/after(\'\*\', handler) are called by bound and unbound events.
- Expanding association from draft-enabled entity to draft enabled entities always provides active version of the expanded entity. 
- If you export a function in an `init.js` file, it will be called with the primary database and its result is awaited.
- REST: Since the service is now based on the `cds.Service` base class, all convenience functions (`create`, `post`, etc.) are streamlined.
- Messaging: Only one queue per app is created, as opposed to one queue per app and external service.
- Messaging: You can now directly connect to the (technical) messaging service through `await cds.connect.to('messaging')`, no topic names will be generated here.
- Messaging: If you want to link your own or external services to messaging you need to model your events in CDS.
- Messaging: If you want to provide custom topics for modeled events, you need to add the `@topic` annotation to the event.
- Messaging: The `prefix` option in the service's credentials is prepended to events that have a `@topic` annotation.
- Messaging: The syntax to emit events with headers changed:
  ```js
  srv.emit({ event: 'yourEvent',
             data: { some: 'data' },
             headers: { some: 'headers' }})
  ```
- Messaging: The default file for `file-based-messaging` is `~/.cds-msg-box`.
- Streamlined handler registration: `srv.before/on/after(<event>, <entity>?, <handler>)`
  - Event and handler are mandatory, entity must be omitted if unbound action/function (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE are considered to be bound)
  - Event and entity may be arrayed
  - `srv.before/on/after(*, <handler>)` matches all as shorthand
- `INSERT` statements return an object or array of objects (in case of bulk) with the number of affected rows as result of `valueOf()`, as well as the keys of the inserted entities:
  ```js
  const res = await srv.run(INSERT.into('Books').entries([{ ID: 1, title: 'one' }, { ID: 2, title: 'two' }]))
  res > 1 // > true
  res.keys // > [{ ID: 1 }, { ID: 2 }]
  ```

### Removed

- Support for run block (`tx.run(() => {})`)

## Version 2.0.3 - 2020-06-19

### Added

- Custom translatable error messages
- Support for containment in CRUD
- Support for static values in custom on conditions for associations

### Changed

- on() function for joins does not support the simple conditions like on(x, =, y) anymore. Only fluent expressions and object predicates are supported.

### Fixed

- Enterprise Messaging: Received messages are correctly decoded 
- Reading single properties of draft enabled entities via navigations e. g. `/E0(ID=<uuid>,IsActiveEntity=false)/e1(ID=<uuid>,IsActiveEntity=false)/property`
- not supported transformation in groupby throws cryptic error
- etag check only if odata request
- Statements if path expression contains keys of type `cds.Timestamp`, `cds.DateTime` or `cds.Time`
- `$filter` lambda `any` operator if no argument is provided
- User attributes in `req.user.attr` merge `info.userInfo` and `info.userAttributes` (authentication strategy `JWT`)
- User authentication challenges

### Removed

- Support for nested user attributes in `@restrict.where`, e.g., `$user.name.familyName`

## Version 2.0.2 - 2020-06-10

### Added

- Support for XSUAA's user attribute value `$UNRESTRICTED`
- Default to combination `[...];IEEE754Compatible=true;ExponentialDecimals=true` if IEEE754Compatible or ExponentialDecimals is omitted
- Use custom authenticate middleware via `cds.env.requires.auth.impl`
- Authentication strategy `dummy` (`cds.env.requires.auth.strategy = 'dummy'`) that creates super users (i.e., pass all authorization checks)
- Support relative destination path in rest-client

### Changed

- CQN returned for req.query changed — for requests with path expressions the returned CQN of req.query is changed to a simplified format. For `GET /Authors(150)/books` the CQN contains the path in `.from` instead of an `exists` clause in `.where`.
```
{ SELECT:  {  from: { "ref": [
        {
          "id": "AdminService.Authors",
          "where": [ { "val": 150 } ]
        },
      "books"
      ] } } }
```
- Authorizations as whitelist: if any restrictions exist for the target, all not explicitly allowed operations are forbidden (e.g., `@restrict: [{ grant: 'READ', ... }]` -> everything but `READ` is forbidden for all, including bound actions and functions)
- Applicable `@requires` and `@restrict` definitions concatinated by AND
- Reference to undefined XSUAA user attribute in `@restrict.where` results in forbidden
- `req.event` for unbound actions and functions is provided without service prefix
- Increased logging in production (temporarily until revised logging concept is implemented)
- `cds.serve(..., { passport: [...] }` -> `cds.serve(..., { auth: [...] }`

### Fixed

- `INSERT.into.as(SELECT.from...)` with `SELECT` containing placeholders
- Requests on a navigation to many with key provided returns 404 if the resource does not exist
- POST/PATCH requests on `Composition of many` with backlink association as key
- Path expressions on HANA are now flat and not structured anymore
- `$expand` on `Composition of many` with backlink association as key
- Roles from scopes including "."
- Ignore unknown arrayed column during input validation
- Too early client release
- Pool configurations with default values can be set to `0`

### Removed

### Changed

- Slightly improved performance for `$expand`
- Return key values (single key only) of created entries instead of number of affected rows
- Annotations `@cds.onInsert` and `@cds.onUpdate` ignore values from the request (see [Managed Data](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/pages/cap/guides/providing-services#managed-data))
- Processing of read-only values moved to initial before handler
- Aligned handling of virtual, computed, read-only, immutable with java runtime
- Allow deep insert on to one association with non-key property, the non-key property is silently ignored 

### Fixed

### Added

- Support for `orderBy` in rest client

### Changed

- `limit` in CQN is translated to placeholders in SQL
- QL API: .where() is changed: 
-- Where with two parameters like .where('x', 1) is not allowed and should be replaced with .where('x', '=', 1).
-- Combinations with partial CQNs like .where({ref: ['x']}, '=', 1) are not allowed. Use arrays of partial CQNs like .where([ {ref: ['x']}, '=', {val: 1} ]) instead.
-- Fluent expressions work as strictly alternating string/value lists (as documented). Partial CQN can be used here as value.
- Per default, results are now ordered by keys of the entity

- CREATE now returns `context.data` if not all non-UUID keys are provided
  and no error is thrown in the database client

### Changed

- Object notation in `.where` of statements does not allow functions anymore
- `context.diff()` ignores `@cds.persistence.skip` annotated entities
- Always try to read from localized views (also by draft enabled entities)
- In multitenant scenario, the CSN model is now always loaded from `@sap/cds-mtx`. Previously, it was only loaded if it was extended.
- Use open source version of `@sap-cloud-sdk/core`
- If a column or column alias is used multiple times in a SELECT query, the query is from now on rejected. Example: `SELECT.from(Foo).columns(['c1', 'c1'])`
